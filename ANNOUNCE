Changes since the last public release (1.2.46):


version 1.2.48beta01 [Febuary 27, 2012]
  Removed two useless #ifdef directives from pngread.c and one from pngrutil.c
  Eliminated redundant png_push_read_tEXt|zTXt|iTXt|unknown code from
    pngpread.c and use the sequential png_handle_tEXt, etc., in pngrutil.c;
    now that png_ptr->buffer is inaccessible to applications, the special
    handling is no longer useful.
  Fixed bug with png_handle_hIST with odd chunk length (Frank Busse).
  Fixed incorrect type (int copy should be png_size_t copy) in png_inflate().
  Fixed off-by-one bug in png_handle_sCAL() when using fixed point arithmetic,
    causing out-of-bounds read in png_set_sCAL() because of failure to copy
    the string terminators (Franke Busse).

version 1.2.48rc01 [March 3, 2012]
  Removed the png_free() of unused png_ptr->current_text from pngread.c.
  Added libpng license text to pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c (requested by Chrome).

version 1.2.48rc02 [March 2, 2012]
  Removed all of the assembler code from pnggccrd.c and just "return 2;".
